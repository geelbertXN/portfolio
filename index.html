            <p><b>Hi! I am GILBERT.</b> <br> <div class="contents"> I first started as a Flash illustrator and animator in 2009 when my friend convinced me to make dress up games for an online kids website. That's also the time when I learned how to code and for me, that was a fun experience. However with sudden turn of events, web browsers dropped support for Adobe Flash and I was forced to shift from Flash to HTML5. That was when I had the opportunity to work in a Google Partner company, and from that day forward, I have been developing rich media ads for different clients and different brands. I will  be happy to share to you my work history over the years.</div> </p>
